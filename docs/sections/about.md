I completed my undergrad majoring in Information Technology from [NSIT, India](http://www.nsit.ac.in/). Following graduation, I wrote a few research papers on a variety of subjects; you can visit my LinkedIn to learn more about them. I am currently working as a software engineer and primarily code using Javascript for both the front end (ReactJS) and back end (NodeJS), but my preferred language remains C++.
I am enthusiastic about web3 technologies and have a good understanding of the XRP Ledger, there is still much to learn and grow.

Come say hi to me on my socials.
