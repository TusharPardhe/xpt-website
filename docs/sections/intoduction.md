## Welcome aboard!

Delighted to see you here. XPT - XRPL Portfolio Tracker, as the name suggests, is a browser plugin that collects and displays information from the XRP Ledger in an appealing manner.

XRP ledger being a decentralised and open ledger where all the information is public, one can track any account of choice!
The extension is not limited to this, there are many other intriguing developments and ideas in progress, such as incorporation of Airdrop calendar, live XRP price updates etc.
To get to know more about what is currently being implemented, visit [Features](./sections/features.md) section. 
There are a lot of cool ideas to develop on. If you've any suggestions/ideas or you want to be a part of the community, don't hesistate and join us on [Twitter]() or [Discord]().

## But! Why use XPT?

A good question!

Currently there are variety of ways through which you can track your XRPL account. A lot of projects are working tirelessly to help users and build a strong community. My main goal with XPT is to support their developments and combine all the information under one umbrella.

There is a lot of information going through XRPL every day, but it might be challenging for the end user to notice it and keep informed. In addition, there are a lot of fascinating projects being built on XRPL, but the majority of them go unrecognised and never receive the appreciation they deserve. The incorporation of "Useful Projects/Links" tab in XPT will give such projects a simple platform to present themselves to users.

Furthermore, many users participate in airdrops, but as more projects grow and carry out such drops, it will become more challenging to collect this data.
An issuer can fill out a structured form provided by XPT to publicise their airdrop date, amount, eligibility requirements, and other key information. 

To help people realise that XRPL is not just a "fast and secure" blockchain but also a "fast, secure, and evolving" blockchain, I have many additional ideas about how to enhance XPT's capabilities and provide the finest user experience.
