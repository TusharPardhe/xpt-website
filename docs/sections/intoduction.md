## Welcome aboard!

Delighted to see you here. XPT - XRPL Portfolio Tracker, as the name suggests, is a browser plugig coded using Javascript that gathers and displays information of any XRP ledger account. 

XRP ledger being a decentralised and open, all the information is public, which means one can track any account of their choice!
The extension is not limited to this, there are many other intriguing developments and ideas in progress, such as incorporation of Airdrop calendar, live XRP price updates etc, useful project links, NFT minting calendar and many more.
To get to know more about what is currently being implemented, visit [Features](/sections/features.md) section. 
There are a lot of cool ideas to develop on. If you've any suggestions/ideas or you want to be a part of the community, don't hesistate and join us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xptxrpl).

## But! Why use XPT?

A good question!

Currently there are variety of ways through which you can track your XRPL account. A lot of projects are working tirelessly to make information more accessible and to build a strong community. My main goal with XPT is to support their developments and combine all the information under one umbrella to increase reachability.

A lot of information goes through XRPL on daily basis, hence it might be challenging for the end user to notice and keep informed. In addition, there are a lot of projects being built on XRPL, but the majority of them go unrecognised and never receive the appreciation they deserve. The incorporation of "Useful Projects/Links" tab in XPT will give such projects a platform to present themselves to users.

Furthermore, many users participate in airdrops, but as more projects grow and carry out such drops, it will become challenging for the users to keep up with airdrops. Using XPT an issuer can fill out a structured form to publicise their airdrop date, amount, eligibility requirements, and other key information. 

Also, I want to build this extension to spread knowledge about XRPL and help people realise that XRPL is not just a "fast and secure" blockchain but also a "fast, secure, and evolving" blockchain, I have many ideas about how to enhance XPT's capabilities and provide the finest user experience.
