## Welcome aboard!

<!-- Delighted to see you here. XPT - XRPL Portfolio Tracker, as the name suggests, is a browser plugig coded using Javascript that gathers and displays information of any XRP ledger account. 

XRP ledger being a decentralised and open blockchain, all the information is public, which means one can track any account of their choice!
The extension is not limited to this, there are many other intriguing developments and ideas in progress, such as incorporation of Airdrop calendar, live XRP price updates, useful project links, NFT minting calendar and many more.
To get to know more about what is currently being implemented, visit [Features](/sections/features.md) section. 
There are a lot of cool ideas to develop on. If you've any suggestions/ideas or you want to be a part of the community, don't hesistate and join us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xptxrpl).

## But! Why use XPT?

A good question!

Currently, there are a variety of ways through which you can track your XRPL account. Many projects are working to improve access to XRP Ledger. My primary objective with XPT is to assist in their development and bring all information under one roof to maximize reachability. 

Since XRPL receives a lot of information daily, it may be difficult for the end-user to notice and stay informed. Furthermore, many projects are functioning on XRPL, but the vast majority of these go unnoticed and never receive the recognition they deserve. The "Useful Initiatives/Links" page to XPT will provide a forum for such projects to offer themselves to consumers. 

Furthermore, many users participate in airdrops, but as more projects grow and carry out drops, it will be a challenge for the users to keep up - projects will miss out on valuable consumers. Using the XPT browser extension: an issuer can fill out a structured form to publicize their airdrop date, amount, eligibility requirements, and other information.
I want to build this extension to spread knowledge about XRPL and help people realize that XRPL is not just a "fast and secure" blockchain but also a "fast, secure, and evolving" blockchain. I have numerous ideas for improving XPT's capabilities and providing the best user experience possible.
Contact us if you would like to submit your idea.
