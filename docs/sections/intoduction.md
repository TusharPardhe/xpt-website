## Welcome aboard!

XPT - XRPL Portfolio Tracker, as the name suggests, is a browser plugin coded using Javascript that gathers and displays information related to any XRP ledger account.

XRP ledger being a decentralised and open blockchain, all the information is public, which means one can track any account of their choice!
This extension allows you to store your favourite accounts and keep track of them at any point of time. Using this extension one can view the upcoming airdrop details, browse through useful project links and information, view XRP live price updates and many more cool stuff.

## But! Why use XPT?

A good question!

Currently, there are a variety of ways through which you can track your XRPL account. Many projects are working to improve access to XRP Ledger. My primary objective with XPT is to make a user-friendly easy to use extenstion that bring all information under one roof. 

XRPL ecosystem is growing rapidly and it may be difficult for the end-user to keep track of ongoing changes. Many projects are functioning on XRPL, but the vast majority of these go unnoticed and never receive the recognition they deserve. The "Useful Projects/Links" page in XPT will provide a forum for such projects to present themselves to consumers. 

Furthermore, many users participate in airdrops, but as more projects grow and carry out drops, it will be a challenge for the users to keep up - projects will miss out on valuable consumers. Using the extension: an issuer can fill out a structured form to publicize their airdrop date, distribution amount, eligibility requirements, and other AD related information.

There are many ideas that can be implemented and a lot of different paths to take, you can visit the [Features](/sections/features.md) section for a detailed view.
