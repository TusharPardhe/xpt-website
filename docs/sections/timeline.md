# Timeline

## `Phase 1:` Brainstorming & Initialisation [July] :hourglass:

In this phase, I'll begin working on the project's core and implement my ideas. Discussions with other developers will be scheduled to obtain critical input and analyze the project's potential and worth.

Furthermore, I'll work on developing backend APIs for getting user information, getting airdrop details, registering for airdrop calendars, etc.

The creation of the application's basic design and layout will also happen during this stage.

## `Phase 2:` Coding & Implementation [Aug]

Defining code logic and milestones will take place during this stage of the project. Incorporating user flow and calendar APIs with the front-end user interface will also begin.

At this stage, workflows such as the previous five transactions, account portfolio, useful project links and social tab, and XRP live updates tab will be worked upon.

## `Phase 3:` Login and User management [Sept]

Managing login information is crucial of the project; security is my top priority. One-way hashing will be used to store user passwords, meaning that even if a database is compromised - retrieving user keys will be an arduos task. However, this also means that once a user loses their keys, they will no longer have access to their accounts. I will use [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js) with 12 rounds of salt for better security. You can read more about one-way hashing by clicking [here](https://en.citizendium.org/wiki/One-way_encryption).

## `Phase 4:` Finalisation [Oct]

During this stage, we will test the whole workflow, and a small number of users will receive the product's beta version.
Project collaborations, project promotion, and incorporating feedback will take place.

## `Phase 5:` Launch [Oct]

We'll be ready to launch after the preceding stages conclude. The extension will be available for download through the Chrome Web Store. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I will do my best to stick to the timeline. I hope you have a wonderful day.

`Lets keep it simple.`
